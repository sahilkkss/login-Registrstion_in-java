1) User Registration:
   The program allows users to register by entering a username, email, and password.
   A predefined verification code ("619619") is used to simulate email verification.
   The user must enter the correct code to complete registration.

2) Login System:
   Users can log in with their username and password.
   After 3 failed login attempts, the account gets locked for 30 minutes.

3) Password Reset: Users can reset their passwords by providing their username.
   
4) Account Locking:
   Accounts are locked after 3 failed login attempts and automatically unlock after 30 minutes.

5) Verification Process:
   A predefined verification code ("619619") is hard coded for registration, simulating an email verification process.

6) Code Simplification:
   We reduced redundancy, streamlined the logic, and removed unnecessary parts to make the code more concise while maintaining all the core features.

7) In a Nutshell:
   User registration involves entering a username, email, password, and verification code.
   Login checks credentials and locks accounts after multiple failed attempts.
   Password reset allows users to change their password by entering their username.
